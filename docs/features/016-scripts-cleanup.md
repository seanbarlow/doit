# Scripts Cleanup and Agent Support Standardization

**Completed**: 2026-01-12
**Branch**: `016-scripts-cleanup`
**Epic**: #36

## Overview

Cleaned up all Bash and PowerShell scripts to remove references to unsupported AI agents, keeping only Claude and GitHub Copilot support. Synchronized `scripts/` (source of truth) to `templates/scripts/` (distribution), created missing `templates/scripts/powershell/` directory, and verified CLI init/update commands work correctly.
