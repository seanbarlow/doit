|----------|-------|
| Critical | 0 |
| Major | 0 |
| Minor | 0 |
| Info | 2 |
| **Total** | **2** |

### Detailed Findings

#### INFO-001: Intentional HTML in Markdown

**File**: README.md, docs/index.md, media/README.md
**Description**: HTML elements used in markdown files for logo display
**Impact**: None - this is the correct approach for centered images with theme support
**Resolution**: By design - GitHub Flavored Markdown supports HTML, and this is the recommended approach for `<picture>` elements with `prefers-color-scheme`

#### INFO-002: Docs Logo Uses Simple IMG

**File**: docs/index.md
**Description**: Documentation uses `<img>` instead of `<picture>` element
**Impact**: None - MkDocs doesn't support GitHub's theme switching mechanism
**Resolution**: By design - documented in plan.md, appropriate for the platform

## Manual Test Requirements
