# Command Workflow Recommendations

**Completed**: 2026-01-10
**Branch**: `012-command-recommendations`
**PR**: TBD

## Overview

Enhanced all doit workflow commands to provide context-aware "Next Steps" recommendations at the end of execution. Each command now analyzes execution results and recommends the most appropriate next command(s) in the workflow, helping users navigate the development lifecycle efficiently. Additionally, a visual workflow progress indicator shows users their current position in the doit lifecycle.

## Requirements Implemented

| ID | Description | Status |
|----|-------------|--------|
| FR-001 | Each doit command displays a "Next Steps" section at end of successful execution | Done |
| FR-002 | Recommendations are context-aware based on command execution results | Done |
| FR-003 | Recommendation section includes specific command to run | Done |
| FR-004 | Commands detect missing prerequisites and recommend prerequisite command | Done |
| FR-005 | Commands display workflow progress indicator showing position in lifecycle | Done |
| FR-006 | Error conditions provide recovery recommendations | Done |
| FR-007 | Auxiliary commands show appropriate next steps for their context | Done |
| FR-008 | Recommendation output is visually distinct from command output | Done |
| FR-009 | Recommendations are concise (1-3 actionable suggestions) | Done |
| FR-010 | Progress indicator shows completed, current, and upcoming steps | Done |

## Technical Details

### Approach
- Template-only changes to existing command markdown files
- No Python CLI modifications required
- Recommendations generated by AI agent at runtime based on context
- Progress indicator uses unicode symbols for cross-platform compatibility

### Key Decisions
- Used markdown box formatting for visual distinction of recommendation sections
- Progress indicator format: `completed steps highlighted, current step, upcoming steps`
- Recommendations are guidance only - users can choose different commands
- Workflow state inferred from file existence (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, etc.)
