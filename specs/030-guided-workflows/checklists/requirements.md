# Specification Quality Checklist: Interactive Guided Workflows

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness
