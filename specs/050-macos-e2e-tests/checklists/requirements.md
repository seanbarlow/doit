# Specification Quality Checklist: macOS E2E Testing Infrastructure

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete and ready for `/doit.planit`.

Key strengths:
- Clear user stories with independent test criteria
- Comprehensive macOS-specific requirements (APFS, BSD utilities, Unicode, etc.)
- Well-defined success criteria focused on measurable outcomes
- Properly scoped with dependencies and out-of-scope items identified
- No implementation details - maintains technology-agnostic approach
