**Project**: [PROJECT_NAME]
**Last Updated**: [DATE]
**Managed by**: `/doit.roadmapit`

## Vision

[PROJECT_VISION]

## Active Requirements

### P1 - Critical (Must Have for MVP)

<!-- Items that are essential for minimum viable product or blocking other work -->

- [ ] [P1_ITEM_1] `[feature-branch-reference]`
  - **Rationale**: [Why this is critical]

### P2 - High Priority (Significant Business Value)

<!-- Items with high business value, scheduled for near-term delivery -->

- [ ] [P2_ITEM_1] `[feature-branch-reference]`
  - **Rationale**: [Why this is high priority]

### P3 - Medium Priority (Valuable)

<!-- Items that add value but can wait for later iterations -->

- [ ] [P3_ITEM_1] `[feature-branch-reference]`
  - **Rationale**: [Why this is medium priority]

### P4 - Low Priority (Nice to Have)

<!-- Items in the backlog, considered for future development -->

- [ ] [P4_ITEM_1] `[feature-branch-reference]`
  - **Rationale**: [Why this is low priority]

---

## Deferred Items

<!-- Items that were considered but intentionally deferred with reason -->

| Item | Original Priority | Deferred Date | Reason |
|------|-------------------|---------------|--------|
| [DEFERRED_ITEM] | [P1-P4] | [DATE] | [REASON] |

---

## Notes

- Items marked with `[###-feature-name]` reference link to feature branches for tracking
- When a feature completes via `/doit.checkin`, matching items are moved to `completed_roadmap.md`
- Use `/doit.roadmapit add [item]` to add new items
- Use `/doit.roadmapit defer [item]` to move items to deferred section
- Use `/doit.roadmapit reprioritize` to change item priorities
